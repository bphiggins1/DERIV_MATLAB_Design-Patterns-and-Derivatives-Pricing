MATLAB Derivatives Pricing
==========================

A MATLAB version of derivatives pricing based on [C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing](http://www.markjoshi.com/design/) by Mark Joshi.

This implementation makes use of [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/mattmcd/mdepin) for constructing the pricing application.  The [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) library is used for pricing some vanilla options as an example of how different pricing engines may be plugged in to the application.
